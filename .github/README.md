<h3 align="center">iamnande - vimfiles</h3>

<br />

<p align="center">
  <b>vimfiles</b> is <i>the</i> ultimate vim setup, when I remember to use it.
</p>

## ✨ Features

- **Whitespace Cleanup:** Automatically clean up whitespace with `:w` or `:x`.
- **Next-Line Indent Tracking:** When continuing on to the next line, indents 
are tracked to keep you typing instead of tabbing (or spacing).
- **Common Syntax Configurations:** Never have to worry about spaces vs tabs in
`Makefile` and get common highlights for `go` functions/methods, structs, 
operators, and build constraints. 

## ⚡️ QuickStart

```shell
$ make clean install
```
